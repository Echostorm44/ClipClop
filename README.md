ClipClop comes from a frustration that none of the available clipboard managers are exactly what I'd like. 

Some are old and look dated or have networking and sharing options that make me nervous. 
Others don't keep your pinned items at the top, or don't let you resize them or don't remember where you want them to open or don't follow your mouse pointer and open on the monitor you're looking at.

So I made my own, I hope you find it useful.

- ClipClop only saves your pinned items to disk and it encrypts the shit out of them when it does.
- ClipClop has a quick search to find that thing you know you copied earlier.  Just hit 's' to jump to the search box and start typing.
- ClipClop it open source, free and doesn't want you data, it stays local and encrypted so you don't have to worry.
- ClipClop is configurable but simple. It will remember how you resized it and will open either in the same spot you put it all the time or on whatever monitor your mouse is on, you pick.
- ClipClop will keep your pinned items at the top, I can't believe that is something we can brag about.
- ClipClop allows you to configure your own hotkey combination to open it.
- You can hit 'escape' to close the window if you forget why you opened it.
- When the window opens you can use your arrow keys and press enter to pick an item from the list.
- Hitting 'Clear All' won't delete your pined items, that wouldn't be cool.
